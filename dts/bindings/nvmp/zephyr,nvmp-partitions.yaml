  This binding is used to describe partitions on non volatile memory.

  Here is an example:

    &flash0 {
            nvmp_partitions {
                    compatible = "zephyr, nvmp-partitions";
                    #address-cells = <1>;
                    #size-cells = <1>;

                    partition0: partition@0 {
                            reg = <0x00000000 0x0000C000>;
                    };
                    partition1: partition@c000 {
                            reg = <0x0000C000 0x00076000>;
                    };
            };
    };

compatible: "zephyr,nvmp-partitions"

properties:
  "#address-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the start offset of each partition.

  "#size-cells":
    type: int
    description: |
      Number of cells required to represent a child node's
      reg property address. This must be large enough to
      represent the size of each partition in bytes.

child-binding:
  description: |
    Each child node of the fixed-partitions node represents
    an individual flash partition. These should usually
    look like this:

      partition_nodelabel: partition@START_OFFSET {
              label = "human-readable-name";
              reg = <0xSTART_OFFSET 0xSIZE>;
      };
  properties:
    label:
      type: string
      description: |
        Human readable string describing the flash partition.
    read-only:
      type: boolean
      description: set this property if the partition is read-only
    reg:
      type: array
      description: |
        This should be in the format <OFFSET SIZE>, where OFFSET
        is the offset of the flash partition relative to the base
        address of the parent memory, and SIZE is the size of
        the partition in bytes.
      required: true
